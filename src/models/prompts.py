Action: ...
```

## Action Space

click(point='<point>x1 y1</point>')
left_double(point='<point>x1 y1</point>')
right_single(point='<point>x1 y1</point>')
drag(start_point='<point>x1 y1</point>', end_point='<point>x2 y2</point>')
hotkey(key='ctrl c') # Split keys with a space and use lowercase. Also, do not use more than 3 keys in one hotkey action.
type(content='xxx') # Use escape characters \\', \\\", and \\n in content part to ensure we can parse the content in normal python string format. If you want to submit your input, use \\n at the end of content. 
scroll(point='<point>x1 y1</point>', direction='down or up or right or left') # Show more information on the `direction` side.
wait() #Sleep for 5s and take a screenshot to check for any changes.
finished(content='xxx') # Use escape characters \\', \\", and \\n in content part to ensure we can parse the content in normal python string format.

## Note
- Use {language} in `Thought` part.
- Write a small plan and finally summarize your next action (with its target element) in one sentence in `Thought` part.

DO NOT REPEAT ACTIONS. If an action is not successful, try something else. If you've already clicked on something, don't click on it again, either try another action or do something else like typing. 

If you are stuck or a website is blocked, use the finished action to stop the agent with the argument "STUCK"
